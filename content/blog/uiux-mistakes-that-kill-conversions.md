Conversion drops rarely come from one catastrophic bug. More often, it’s a chain of small UI/UX decisions that add friction, reduce trust, and make “yes” feel harder than “no”. The good news: these problems are measurable, fixable, and usually don’t require a redesign.

Below are five conversion-killers we see most often—plus fixes you can implement with a clear checklist.

## 1) Weak information hierarchy (everything screams)

**The mistake:** Pages where headings, CTAs, cards, and badges all compete for attention. When every element is “important,” users can’t quickly answer: *What is this? Is it for me? What should I do next?*

**How to fix it:**

- Define **one primary action** per screen (e.g., “Book a demo”, “Start free trial”).
- Use a simple hierarchy: **H1 → 2–3 key benefits → proof → CTA**.
- Reduce visual noise: fewer colors, fewer font sizes, fewer competing buttons.

**Quick test:** Hide everything except the hero section. Can a first-time visitor understand the offer in 5 seconds?

## 2) Asking for too much, too early (form friction)

**The mistake:** Long signup forms, forced account creation, or requesting sensitive data before users understand the value. Every extra field is a decision—and decisions cost conversions.

**How to fix it:**

- Remove fields that aren’t essential for the first step.
- Use **progressive profiling**: collect more later, after value is proven.
- Enable a low-commitment path (e.g., “Continue with email” + “Explore features”).

**Rule of thumb:** If a field doesn’t change what you can do for the user *right now*, it probably doesn’t belong in the first form.

## 3) CTAs that are unclear, generic, or inconsistent

**The mistake:** Buttons like “Submit” or “Get Started” without context. Even worse: different wording across pages (“Sign up”, “Start”, “Register”, “Join”) for the same action. This increases cognitive load and creates doubt.

**How to fix it:**

- Make CTA copy **specific and value-based** (e.g., “Get pricing”, “See the demo”, “Start a 14-day trial”).
- Keep the primary CTA consistent across the journey.
- Add microcopy near the CTA to reduce anxiety:
  - “No credit card required”
  - “Takes 2 minutes”
  - “Cancel anytime”

**Bonus:** If the CTA triggers an external flow (calendar, payment, email), set expectations before the click.

## 4) Slow, jumpy pages (performance + layout shifts)

**The mistake:** A site that feels sluggish, or content that moves while loading (CLS). Users interpret this as unreliability—especially on mobile networks.

**How to fix it (practical):**

- Prioritize above-the-fold assets (optimize images, defer non-critical scripts).
- Reserve space for dynamic elements (avoid layout shifts).
- Measure and monitor:
  - **LCP** (largest contentful paint)
  - **CLS** (cumulative layout shift)
  - **INP** (interaction to next paint)

**Conversion reality:** A 1–2 second delay can noticeably reduce signups on high-intent pages.

## 5) Missing trust signals where decisions happen

**The mistake:** Trust signals (testimonials, logos, guarantees, security notes) are buried on an “About” page—or absent near pricing, forms, and checkout. Users hesitate when risk feels ambiguous.

**How to fix it:**

- Add **social proof next to the CTA**, not just below the fold.
- Use proof that answers common objections:
  - Outcomes (“Reduced onboarding time by 30%”)
  - Credibility (client logos, certifications)
  - Risk reduction (refund policy, support response time)
- Replace vague claims (“Best-in-class”) with concrete specifics.

**Simple win:** Put one relevant testimonial directly under your primary CTA on the pricing page.

### A practical next step

Pick one high-traffic, high-intent page (pricing, signup, lead form). Run a 30-minute audit using the five points above, then ship **two small changes** and measure impact:

- baseline conversion rate (before)
- conversion rate (after)
- supporting metrics (scroll depth, form completion, time-to-first-action)

UI/UX improvements compound. The teams that win aren’t the ones who redesign constantly—they’re the ones who remove friction relentlessly.
